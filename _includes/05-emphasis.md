I am a __researcher__, unconditionally passionate about data visualization and data journalism, and self-taught in the area of __data analytics__. In every work experience I've had so far, I've found ways to do things _better and faster_ by working with data. _Self-motivated and efficient_, I began to earn certifications and take increasingly difficult courses in data analytics, while gaining confidence that this was the only career path that could give me satisfaction. Whether I am doing course assignments or at work, I always strive to organize and present data in a way that appeals to people and provides them with _valuable information_. Through past experience, I can communicate effectively with people and understand their expectations. I am __detail-oriented, meticulous and love to get into the details__. Most importantly, I am curious about the world around me and this curiosity drives me to action.
